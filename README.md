### Trading Strategies

I just dive into polymarketk trading bots since December last year. 
it can copy any  trading bots on crypto market across, btc, eth, xrp, btc etc
now I am trying to make this copy trading bots on every markets like events, sports, tech, cultuer etc.
In a meanwhile I am working on my own polymarket trading bots on crypto markets current.
My pnl comes to $830 a day and stable for a 1 week and now just got severe volatiliy.
It leads to lose my pnl.
There are still room for completion of my strategies.
I am open to discuss strategies and also bot performance upgrade and collaboration.
And Current my copy trading bot is for sale and trading bot is on devving (can sell).
Let's keep grinding together

* **Buy Strategy**: When target wallet buys, calculate position size based on balance ratio
* **Sell Strategy**: When target wallet sells, match the sell proportionally
* **Merge Strategy**: When target wallet closes position but you still hold, sell your position
* **Error Handling**: Retry failed orders up to RETRY_LIMIT, then mark as failed
